# Automated Case Assignment & Escalation System

## Overview

This Salesforce project implements an intelligent case management system that automatically assigns incoming support cases to the most appropriate agents and escalates high-priority or unresolved cases based on predefined business rules. The system helps organizations streamline their customer support operations and ensure timely resolution of customer issues.

## Features

### üéØ Smart Case Assignment
- **Skill-Based Routing**: Cases are automatically assigned to agents based on their expertise and current workload
- **Round-Robin Distribution**: Ensures even distribution of cases among available agents
- **Priority-Based Assignment**: High-priority cases are routed to senior agents or specialists
- **Geography-Based Routing**: Cases can be assigned based on customer location and agent timezone

### ‚ö° Intelligent Escalation
- **Time-Based Escalation**: Automatically escalates cases that haven't been resolved within SLA timeframes
- **Priority Escalation**: Escalates high-priority cases to management if not acknowledged quickly
- **Multiple Escalation Levels**: Supports multi-tier escalation paths (Level 1 ‚Üí Level 2 ‚Üí Management)
- **Custom Escalation Rules**: Flexible rule engine for different case types and business scenarios

### üìä Real-Time Monitoring
- **Agent Workload Dashboard**: Visual representation of current case distribution
- **SLA Tracking**: Monitor case resolution times against defined SLAs
- **Escalation Reports**: Track escalation patterns and identify bottlenecks
- **Performance Metrics**: Agent productivity and case resolution analytics

## Technical Architecture

### Salesforce Components
- **Custom Objects**: Extended Case object with custom fields for assignment rules
- **Apex Triggers**: Real-time case processing and assignment logic
- **Flow Automation**: Visual workflow for escalation processes
- **Lightning Components**: Custom UI components for case management
- **Integration APIs**: REST endpoints for external system integration

### Key Technologies
- Salesforce Lightning Platform
- Apex Programming Language
- Lightning Web Components (LWC)
- Salesforce Flow Builder
- SOQL/SOSL for data queries
- Salesforce REST API

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Salesforce Developer/Production Org
- System Administrator access
- Salesforce CLI (optional, for deployment)

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-case-assignment-escalation.git
   cd automated-case-assignment-escalation
   ```

2. **Deploy to Salesforce**
   - Use Salesforce CLI or deploy via VS Code with Salesforce Extensions
   - Import sample data using Data Loader or Data Import Wizard

3. **Configure Assignment Rules**
   - Navigate to Setup ‚Üí Case Assignment Rules
   - Activate the provided assignment rules
   - Customize rules based on your organization's needs

4. **Set Up Escalation Rules**
   - Go to Setup ‚Üí Escalation Rules
   - Configure escalation timeframes and recipients
   - Test escalation workflows

## Configuration Guide

### Assignment Rule Setup
1. **Agent Skills Configuration**
   - Define skill sets for each support agent
   - Set experience levels (Junior, Senior, Expert)
   - Configure language preferences

2. **Case Categories**
   - Set up case types (Technical, Billing, General)
   - Define priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   - Configure product-specific routing

3. **Business Hours**
   - Configure support hours for different regions
   - Set up holiday schedules
   - Define after-hours assignment rules

### Escalation Configuration
1. **SLA Definitions**
   - Response time SLAs by priority
   - Resolution time targets
   - Customer tier-based SLAs

2. **Escalation Paths**
   - Level 1: Assigned Agent ‚Üí Team Lead
   - Level 2: Team Lead ‚Üí Department Manager
   - Level 3: Manager ‚Üí VP of Customer Success

## Usage Examples

### Basic Case Assignment
```apex
// Example: Automatic assignment when case is created
Case newCase = new Case(
    Subject = 'Product Integration Issue',
    Priority = 'High',
    Type = 'Technical',
    Product__c = 'API Platform'
);
insert newCase;
// System automatically assigns to API specialist
```

### Manual Escalation
```apex
// Example: Manual escalation trigger
Case escalatedCase = [SELECT Id, OwnerId FROM Case WHERE Id = :caseId];
EscalationService.escalateCase(escalatedCase, 'Urgent customer request');
```

## Customization

The system is designed to be highly customizable:

- **Assignment Logic**: Modify `CaseAssignmentHandler.cls` to implement custom assignment algorithms
- **Escalation Rules**: Update Flow processes to change escalation criteria
- **UI Components**: Customize Lightning components for organization-specific workflows
- **Integration**: Extend REST API for third-party system integration

## Testing

Run the test suite to ensure everything works correctly:

```bash
# Run all tests
sfdx force:apex:test:run --testlevel RunLocalTests

# Run specific test class
sfdx force:apex:test:run --classnames CaseAssignmentTest
```

Test coverage: 95%+ (Required for production deployment)

## Performance Considerations

- **Bulk Processing**: Handles up to 200 cases per batch operation
- **Governor Limits**: Optimized to stay within Salesforce limits
- **Caching**: Implements platform cache for frequently accessed assignment rules
- **Async Processing**: Uses future methods for time-intensive operations

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Average case assignment time
- Escalation rates by team/agent
- SLA compliance percentage
- Agent workload distribution

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Review and update assignment rules quarterly
- Analyze escalation patterns monthly
- Update agent skills and capacity
- Monitor system performance and optimize

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Cases Not Being Assigned**
   - Check if assignment rules are active
   - Verify agent availability and capacity
   - Review case assignment criteria

2. **Escalations Not Triggering**
   - Confirm escalation rules are enabled
   - Check business hours configuration
   - Verify email templates and recipients

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor batch job status
   - Check for governor limit exceptions
   - Review debug logs for bottlenecks
